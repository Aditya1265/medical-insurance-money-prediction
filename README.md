# <u>Medical-Insurance-Money-Prediction</u>
# Overview

This project is a simple Insurance Medical Money Predictor built using Simple Linear Regression. The application predicts the insurance charges based on medical data such as age, BMI, and other relevant features. It serves as a starting point to demonstrate how regression models can be applied to real-world datasets in the insurance domain.

# Features

* Simple Linear Regression: Implements a straightforward regression algorithm.
* Predictive Analytics: Provides predictions for medical insurance costs.
* Dataset Exploration: Includes basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
* Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Future Work

*Expand the model to support Multiple Linear Regression.
*Include additional features like smoking status or region.
*Experiment with other regression algorithms such as Ridge Regression or Random Forest Regressor.
